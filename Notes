Open Questions:
Is there a way to mathematically describe covering UP?
Is there  a way for theia to get me contact relations/times?
Is there a nice way to modell weight transfer?
How do i understand total body angular momentum?


Interesting variables to analyze:

  Left elbow:
    Jans Stability metric
    elbow speed at impact
    pelvis rotation
    Weight transfer
    elbow angle at impact
    (Speed of retraction not necessary -> unnatural usually clinch or further elbows)
    (blocking with other hand)
    
Uppercut:
    Jans Stability metric
    Wrist Speed
    distance from wrist to thorax
    Speed of retraction
    pelvis rotation
    Weight transfer
    (blocking with other hand)

  Teep:
    Jans Stability metric
    COM Movement
    Hip displacement to the front
    discrepancy in start and landing position
    Time spent in air before/after impact
    ankle velocity at impact
    (block not so relevant)

  Kick:
    Jans Stability metric
    Duration of kicking phases ( preparation, execution, impact, recovery)
    acceleration of hip knee and ankle
    angle of shin on impact
    hip rotation
    Toe velocity at impact
    COM movement
    discrepancy in start and landing position
    (blocking with non kicking side hand)
