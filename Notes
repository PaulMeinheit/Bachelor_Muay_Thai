Left elbow:  
   Total duration <- report as table
   elbow speed at impact velocity overall  <- plot it first, if nothing fruitful, exclude
   shoulder trajectory
   pelvis rotation  <- about Z axis
   Fz trajectories
   COM (ground projection) and COP trajectories

Uppercut:  
   Total duration <- report as table
   Wrist Speed  
   distance from wrist to thorax <- wrist joint position and thorax position AP dir
   pelvis rotation  <- about Z axis
   Fz trajectories
   COM (ground projection) and COP trajectories
   Block behaviour

  Teep:  
      Duration of kick phase (double support, single support, double support) <- report as table
      Rate of chnage of total angular momnetum with respect to full body com about each axis 
      AMAC
      AMOC
      COM Height trajectory
      COM (ground projection) and COP trajectories
      Pelvis movement( maybe hip joint centre) to the front teepin hip
      Fz trajectories
  Kick:  
      AMAC
      AMOC
      Duration of kick phases ( preparation, execution, impac, recovery) <- report as table
      Angular momentum full body and all bodyparts about each axis  
      Rate of chnage of total angular momnetum with respect to full body com about each axis 
      COM Height trajectory
      COM (ground projection) and COP trajectories
      Fz trajectories


First recording session:
all went well
ducttape on forceplate
10 repetitions for each movement 
5 minute selfdirected warmup
as many practice kicks as desired to get comfortable
