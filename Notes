Open Questions:
Is there a way to mathematically describe covering UP?
Is there  a way for theia to get me contact relations/times?
Is there a nice way to modell weight transfer?
How do i understand total body angular momentum?
nice way to splice data into their respective trials

Interesting variables to analyze

  Left elbow:
    Jans Stability metric
    elbow speed at impact
    pelvis rotation
    Weight transfer
    (Speed of retraction not necessary -> grabs or furtehr elbows)
    (blocking with other hand)
    
Uppercut:
    Jans Stability metric
    Wrist Speed
    distance from wrist to thorax
    Speed of retraction
    pelvis rotation
    Weight transfer
    (blocking with other hand)

  Teep:
    Jans Stability metric
    COM Movement
    Hip displacement to the front
    Retraction after impact
    discrepancy in start and landing position
    Time spent in air before/after impact
    ankle velocity at impact
    (block not so relevant)

  Kick:
    Jans Stability metric
    Duration of kicking phases ( preparation, execution, impac, recovery)
    knee angle at impact
    angle of shin on impact
    hip rotation
    Toe velocity at impact
    COM movement
    (blocking with non kickinng side hand)
