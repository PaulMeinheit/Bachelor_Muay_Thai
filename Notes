Open Questions:
Is there a way to mathematically describe covering UP?
Is there  a way for theia to get me contact relations/times?


Interesting variables to analyze

    Jans Stability metric
    elbow speed at impact
    
Uppercut:
    Jans Stability metric
    Wrist Speed
    distance from wrist to thorax
    Speed of retraction
    pelvis rotation

  Teep:
    Jans Stability metric
    COM Movement
    Hip displacement to the front
    Retraction after impact
    discrepancy in start and landing position
    Time spent in air before/after impact
    ankle velocity at impact

  Kick:
    Jans Stability metric
    Duration of kicking phases
    Toe velocity at impact
    COM movement
