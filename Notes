 Open Questions:
Is there a way to mathematically describe covering UP?
Is there  a way for theia to get me contact relations/times?
Is there a nice way to modell weight transfer?
How do i understand total body angular momentum?


Interesting variables to analyze:

  Left elbow:
    Jans Stability Measure
    elbow speed at impact velocity overall
    elbow trajectory
    pelvis rotation
    Weight transfer
    elbow angle at impact
    (Speed of retraction not necessary -> unnatural usually clinch or further elbows)
    (blocking with other hand)
    
Uppercut:
    Jans Stability metric
    Wrist Speed
    distance from wrist to thorax
    pelvis rotation
    Weight transfer
    (blocking with other hand)

  Teep:
    Jans Stability metric
    COM Movement
    Pelvis movement( maybe hip joint centre) to the front teepin hip
    Time Retraction after impact
    discrepancy in start and landing position
    Time spent in air before/after impact(phases)
    ankle velocity
    (block not so relevant)

  Kick:
    Jans Stability Measure
Angular momentum full body and all bodyparts about each axis
Rate of chnage of total angular momnetum with respect to full body com about each axis
for all motions
    Duration of kicking phases ( preparation, execution, impac, recovery)
    knee angle at impact
    angle of shin on impact
    hip rotation
    Ankle velocity at impact
    COM movement
    discrepancy in start and landing position
    (blocking with non kicking side hand



First recording session:
all went well
ducttape on forceplate
10 repetitions for each movement 
5 minute selfdirected warmup
as many practice kicks as desired to get comfortable
