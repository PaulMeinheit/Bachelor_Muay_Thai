 Open Questions:
Is there a way to mathematically describe covering UP?
Is there  a way for theia to get me contact relations/times?
Is there a nice way to modell weight transfer?
How do i understand total body angular momentum?


Interesting variables to analyze

  Left elbow:
    Jans Stability Measure
    elbow speed at impact velocity overall
    elbow trajectory
    pelvis rotation
    Weight transfer
    (Speed of retraction not necessary -> grabs or furtehr elbows)
    (blocking with other hand)
    
Uppercut:
    Jans Stability metric
    Wrist Speed
    distance from wrist to thorax
    pelvis rotation
    Weight transfer
    (blocking with other hand)

  Teep:
    Jans Stability metric
    COM Movement
    Pelvis movement( maybe hip joint centre) to the front teepin hip
    Time Retraction after impact
    discrepancy in start and landing position
    Time spent in air before/after impact(phases)
    ankle velocity
    (block not so relevant)

  Kick:
    Jans Stability Measure
Angular momentum full body and all bodyparts about each axis
Rate of chnage of total angular momnetum with respect to full body com about each axis
for all motions
    Duration of kicking phases ( preparation, execution, impac, recovery)
    knee angle at impact
    angle of shin on impact
    hip rotation
    Ankle velocity at impact
    COM movement
    (blocking with non kickinng side hand)
